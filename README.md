# 📊 **trAIde: Algorithmic Trading Web Application** 💹💻

## 📚 **Project Overview**
**trAIde** is an advanced **algorithmic trading web application** designed to automate intraday trading strategies. By leveraging statistical analysis and technical indicators, the application identifies trading opportunities, executes trades, and manages portfolios efficiently and independantly.

The system analyzes historical market data and applies a combination of **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**, **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, and **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**, along with the **Double Cross Moving Average (DCMA)** technique, to make precise trading decisions.

With the implementation of **multithreading**, the application simultaneously executes trades across **5 selected companies**, ensuring diversification and increased computational efficiency.

## 🚀 **Key Features**
- 📊 **Technical Indicators:** SMA, RSI, EMA, and DCMA for accurate trade analysis.
- 🤖 **Automated Trade Execution:** Trades executed based on flagged crossovers and trend validation.
- ⚡ **Multithreading:** Parallel trade execution across 5 companies.
- 📈 **Profit Optimization:** Achieved approximately **17.89% compounded annual profit** when tested against historical 5-minute interval data.
- 🌐 **Web Application Interface:** User-friendly interface for monitoring and analysis.
